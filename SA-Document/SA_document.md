![](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/10/01/uUDwhF.jpg)

## Abstract

Scrapy (/ ˈ s k r eɪ p i / SKRAY -pee) is a free and open-source web-crawling framework written in Python. Originally designed for web scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs or as a general-purpose web crawler. It is currently maintained by Scrapinghub Ltd., a web-scraping development and services company.

Written in: Python\
Initial release: 26 June 2008\
Developer(s): Scrapinghub, Ltd.\
Stable release: 1.7.3, / 1 August 2019; 6 days ago

While the development is open-source, the amount of documentation about contributing is limited. This results in a project where programming is not done through conventions or guidelines but with a strong focus on getting things to work. Therefore, this document as a whole can serve as a helpful introduction to prospective developers looking to better understand the architecture to which they might contribute.

## Introduction

As we enter the era of big data, data analysis and data collection technologies become particularly important. With the demand of an easy to collect data, scrapy arises.Scrapy is an application framework written to crawl web site data and extract structural data. It can be used in a series of programs including data mining, information processing or storing historical data.It is originally designed for page fetching (more specifically, Web fetching) and can be used to retrieve data returned by the API (for example, Amazon Associates Web Services) or general purpose Web crawlers.

*Fugure 1: The main page of scrapy*

This document gives an overview of the overarching architecture of the scrapy project. It sets the scenes by introducing the project and discussing its stakeholders. It then takes on different viewpoints and perspectives as defined by Rozanski and Woods  to analyse scrapy's performance, in addition to discussing the technical debt hidden in the depths of the codebase.

## Stakeholders

>   A stakeholder is a member of "groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist".

As the definition above, stakeholders in Scrapy are people who are interested in and influence Scrapy. More specificly, stakeholders can adivce to it and make some influence on Scrapy's policy and so on. So, we will firstly have a glimpse on the overview of the stakeholders which includes developers, maintainers, users and other kinds of stakeholders which are of vital importance. After we have had an overview of those kinds of stakeholdes, we will have a deeper appreciation of those stakeholders and try to give the Power Interest Graph of Scrapy in which we will analyze the reason.<a href="#ref_sta1">[1]</a>

### Overview 

-   Acquirers
    
    Scrapy is now managed by **Scrapinghub**. Scrapinghub is specializes in web crawling, and it was founded by Scrapy creators.

-   Developers

    Because Scrapy is an open source project, so developers can be found on Github. Although there are thousands of brilliant developers who have contributed to Scrapy, in order to specify the core developers of Scrapy more clearly, we will mainly discuss the core team which based on the statistics on Github to show the most contributed developers in this case, such as: @[dangra](https://github.com/dangra), @[redapple](https://github.com/redapple), @[kmike](https://github.com/kmike). And the following table contains those Most contributed developers in trems of commit number.

    Developer     | Commits | Additions | Deletions
    --------------|---------|-----------|----------
    dangra        | 738     | 83,176    | 95,953
    redapple      | 392     | 9,643     | 3,146
    kmike         | 327     | 8,441     | 6,586
    void          | 246     | 20,266    | 13,201
    curita        | 174     | 12,211    | 10,056
    lopuhin       | 133     | 1,221     | 701
    elacuesta     | 128     | 4,049     | 2,476
    eliasdorneles | 116     | 2,725     | 2,956

    *Table 1: Most contributed developers in trems of commit number*

-   Maintainers

    Maintainers are responsible for managing the development and evolution of Scrapy. In Scrapy, the core teams described above work as maintainers. They discuss the development direction of Scrapy and they accept and review pull-requests. We can view the main contributors from the statistics on Github. And the core mintainers are the same as those developers above.
 
-   Users

    Scrapy has been used by both big companies like **PARSE.LY**, **Direct Employers Foundation**, government institution like **DATA.GOV.UK** and many other personal users who want to extracte the data you need from websites.

-   Suppliers
    
    The development of Scrapy is coordinated by **Github**, which can be clearly classified as a supplier. Meanwhile, **Python** is the scripting language that Scrapy uses, so we also regard Python as a supplier.

-   Communicators
    
    Scrapy has large and active communities on **Github**, **Reddit** and **StackOverflow**. These communities have tens of thousands of communicators which can help explaining the system to other stakeholders via documentation and the experiences they have.

-   Competitors
    
    As we all know, there are tons of framework that can extracte data from the Internet. For Scrapy, there are competitor as **PySpider**, **Crawley** and **Portia**. Competitor can help Scrapy to be better and supervise it to move forward.

The following figure shows the stakeholders mentioned above, and it proides a channel through which people can have a more direct impression of those stakeholders.

*Figure 2: Power Interest Grid*

-   Low power and low interest
    
    Suppliers like GitHub are stakeholders that have no control over Scrapy, and they do not have directly benefit from it. For Github, they should be in the low power and low interest part.

-   Low power and high interest
    
    Users, Communicators and Competitors of Scrapy are stakeholders who have high interest in Scrapy and will be greatly affected by the changes in Scrapy, but they have nearly no power to influence it.

-   High power and low interest
    
    Suppliers like Python provide necessary library and tools to develop Scrapy. The changes of Python will directly affect the development of Scrapy but Scrapy has little influence on Python on the contrary.

-   High power and high interest
    
    Core developers and acquirers of Scrapy are stakeholders who have significant interest and power in the development of Scrapy. And in Scrapy, developers are also maintainers, so those people will guarantee it to run without error and provide new features. At the same time, acquirers will provide many kinds of support. Both of them can also largely influence Scrapy, so they will be in the high power and low interest part.

## Content-view

A context view describes the relationships, dependencies, and the interactions between the system and its environment.Many architecture descriptions focus on views that model the system’s internal structures, data elements, interactions, and operation. Architects tend to assume that the “outward-facing” information — the system’s runtime context, its scope and requirements, and so forth – is clearly and unambiguously defined elsewhere. However, you often need to include a definition of the system’s context as part of your architectural description.<a href="#ref_con1">[2]</a>

### System Scope
Scrapy is an open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites.The client can use this framework in a fast, simple, yet extensible way[[1]]().It is originally designed for page fetching (more specifically, Web fetching) and can aslo be used to retrieve data returned by the API (for example, [Amazon Associates Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/associates/)) or general purpose Web crawlers.
### Client
The attraction is that Scrapy is a framework that anyone can easily modify to suit their needs.Scrapy features a fast, high-level screen scraping and web scraping framework developed in Python for scraping web sites and extracting structured data from pages.Scrapy has a wide range of applications, including data mining, monitoring and automated testing. Reactive updates are dead simple.

## Development-view

This section describes the architecture that supports React development process. First, we will describe principles and guidelines that govern the development of Scrapy. This will be followed by source code and module organizaton.
##4.1 Development characteristics
Scrapy is a fast high-level web crawling framework, used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, from data mining to monitoring and automated testing<a href="#ref_dev_1">[3]</a>. It's normal for us to compare Scrapy to Request lib, so the developent of characteristics of Scrapy should be  recounted.

#### Asynchronous processing
One of the main advantages about Scrapy is that: requests are scheduled and processed asynchronously. This means that Scrapy doesn’t need to wait for a request to be finished and processed, it can send another request or do other things in the meantime. This also means that other requests can keep going even if some request fails or an error happens while handling it.<a href="#ref_dev_2">[4]</a>
#### Convenient request settings
Scrapy  gives you control over the politeness of the crawl through a few settings You can do things like setting a download delay between each request, limiting amount of concurrent requests per domain or per IP, and even [using an auto-throttling extension](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#topics-autothrottle) that tries to figure out these automatically.
####Built-in parser
 Built-in support for selecting and extracting data from HTML/XML sources using extended CSS selectors and XPath expressions, with helper methods to extract using regular expressions.
#### interactive shell console
The Scrapy shell is an interactive shell where you can try and debug your scraping code very quickly, without having to run the spider. It’s meant to be used for testing data extraction code, but you can actually use it for testing any kind of code as it is also a regular Python shell.<a href="#ref_dev_3">[5]</a>
#### wild middlewares for handling
Scrapy privides wide range of built-in extensions and middlewares for handling:cookies and session handling, http compression,authentication, caching, user-agent spoofing, robots.txt, crawl depth restriction and more.<a href="#ref_dev_4">[6]</a>

### Code Organization
The following figure shows the source code organization of scrapy.
![Figure1 code organization of scrapy](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/17534427-80fbf5f00989de4e.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)
#### Test files
Source code attachs a test project, placed in the tests folder. This test project create ```TestSprider``` object to implement spider and use ```ScrapyRedisBloomFilter``` to remove duplication. We can use console to ```scrapy crawl test``` to run this test project. It casts most of functions of scrapy.
#### Funtional  files
The functionality part contains the components that are responsible for functions of the project. *Commands* implements the console tool of scrapy. *http* integrate the HTTP processing functions. The most important  is *core* , which includes the significant module of scrapy such as *engine*, *scheduler*, *scraper* and so on. These core modules'  relationship will be analized later.
#### Documentations
The documentation section contains codes used to demonstrate and generate the documentation of Scrapy. They are often written in RST format. *README.rst* contains the usage and installation of  Scrapy. *docs* contains the Materials used by documents like pictures and logo.
#### Others
Scrapy has other files, such as version log files, contributor log files, and relatively independent script files.

### Module Organization
This section focuses on the main modules of scrapy and their interactions.
#### Modules introduction
##### Scrapy Engine
The engine is responsible for controlling the data flow between all components of the system, and triggering events when certain actions occur. 
##### Scheduler
The Scheduler receives requests from the engine and enqueues them for feeding them later (also to the engine) when the engine requests them.
##### Downloader
The Downloader is responsible for fetching web pages and feeding them to the engine which, in turn, feeds them to the spiders.
##### Spiders
Spiders are custom classes written by Scrapy users to parse responses and extract items (aka scraped items) from them or additional requests to follow.
##### Item Pipeline
The Item Pipeline is responsible for processing the items once they have been extracted (or scraped) by the spiders. Typical tasks include cleansing, validation and persistence (like storing the item in a database). 
The following diagram shows an overview of the Scrapy architecture with its components and an outline of the data flow that takes place inside the system (shown by the red arrows).
#### Modules' relationship and Data flow

The following diagram shows an overview of the Scrapy architecture with its components and an outline of the data flow that takes place inside the system (shown by the red arrows). The data flow is also described below.<a href="#ref_dev_5">[7]</a>

![Figure 2 data flow](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/17534427-a835f7ea3b5767fa.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)
The data flow in Scrapy is controlled by the execution engine, and goes like this:

1.  The *Engine* gets the initial Requests to crawl from the *Spider*
2.  The *Engine*  schedules the Requests in the *schedules*  and asks for the next Requests to crawl.
3.  The *Schedules* returns the next Requests to the *Engine* 
4.  The *Engine* sends the Requests to the *Downloader*, passing through the *Downloader Middlewares*
5.  Once the page finishes downloading the [Downloader] and sends it to the Engine, passing through the *Downloader Middlewares*
6.  The*Engine* receives the Response from the *Downloader* for processing, passing through the *Spider*
7.  The *Spider* processes the Response and returns scraped items and new Requests (to follow) to the *Engine*
8.  The *Engine* sends processed items to *Item Pipelines*, then send processed Requests to the *Scheduler* and asks for possible next Requests to crawl.
9.  The process repeats (from step 1) until there are no more requests from the *Schedules*
