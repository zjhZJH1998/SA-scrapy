## Stakeholders

>   In a corporation, a stakeholder is a member of "groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist".<a href="#ref_sta1">[1]</a>

As the definition above, stakeholders in Angular are interested in and influence Angular. More specifically, stakeholders can make a huge impact on Angular. Let's look at Angular's stakeholders, which include developers, maintainers, users, and other very important roles. After that we will have a deeper understanding and try to give the Power Interest Graph of Angular.

### Overview 

-   Acquirers
    
   Acquirers, or called as investors, is the first part of the chain which decides the survival of tech companies. They are more concerned about the profit model of the product and the specific operation cost and market profit of the product. Angular's predecessor was Angular. AngularJS was born in 2009 and was created by **Misko Hevery** and others and later acquired by **Google**. Angular is built by a team of engineers who share a passion for making web development feel effortless, and now Angular is managed by them and their collaborators. Actually they are a large group of people, so we just list some of them.

-   Developers

    As an open-source program on GitHub, dozens of developers would like to take part in this job. We can easily find them on GitHub. To make it clearer who contributed the most to Angular, here we list the contributors sorted by number of commits.

    Developer     | Commits | Additions | Deletions
    --------------|---------|-----------|----------
    @[petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)        | 1120     | 406,538    | 247,475
    @[gkalpak](https://github.com/gkalpak)      | 933     | 96,310     | 65,985
    @[vsavkin](https://github.com/vsavkin)         | 952     | 165,431     | 117,393
    @[vicb](https://github.com/vicb)          | 916     | 160,889    | 182,997
    @[IgorMinar](https://github.com/IgorMinar)        | 856     | 244,201    | 221,320

    *Table 1: Most contributed developers in trems of commit number*

-   Maintainers

   Maintainers are responsible for managing the development and evolution of Angular. They discuss the development direction of Angular. What’s more, they accept and review pull-requests. We can view the main contributors on GitHub. They are the same as the Developers above.
 
-   Users

    Angular is an MVVM framework used by **Google** and other front-end engineers in major projects.

-   Suppliers
    
    **GitHub** can be regarded as the supplier of Angular owing to it coordinated the process of Angular’s development. Besides, **JavaScript** is the language of Angular, which can be also considered as the supplier.

-   Communicators
    
    Angular has some large communities on **GitHub**, **Gitter**，**Stack Overflow** and so on. Every stakeholder of Angular can get help and find more about Angular here.

-   Competitors
    
   Obviously, there are a lot of companies which also engaged in front-end development, such as **Vue** and **React**.

### Power Interest Grid

The following figure shows the Power Interest Grid. Power Interest Grid contains the main stakeholder categories and more detailed explanation will be listed.

*Figure 2: Power Interest Grid*

-   Low power and low interest
    
    Users, GitHub are stakeholders who do not has any control over Angular, and do not have significant roles in the development of Angular.

-   Low power and high interest
    
    GitHub is the supplier of Angular and follow the latest development of Angular. Besides, the communities of Angular on GitHub, Gitter and Stake Overflow are the communicators. They are active in the discussion of Angular, but they do not have significant power to directly change the Angular. What’s more, the Competitors of Angular will be greatly affected by the changes in Angular, but they have nearly no power to influence it.
    
-   High power and low interest
    
    JavaScript are stakeholders who directly affect the development of Angular because JavaScript is the language Angular uses. But JavaScript won’t pay attention on Angular.

-   High power and high interest
    
    Core developers, maintainers and acquirers have significant interest and power in developing Angular.
